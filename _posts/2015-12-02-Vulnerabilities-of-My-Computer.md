title: Vulnerabilities of My Computer
---

I think that a major vulnerable spot on my computer is how easy it is to obtain my IP address. I go on many unlocked wireless networks and if to say that someone hacked the system I was connected to, they could gain access to many things on my computer. I think a solution to this, would be to mask my IP address when I connect to such networks so I could surf the web without revealing and identity for hackers to build off of.

Another weakness, I think, is downloadable viruses. I am relatively careless about my downloads. I often download things that I have not really verified. A solution would be to download (and maybe pay for) a good antivirus program and be careful what I download.

Finally, I think my computer could be in danger of  possible over usage which could cause it to burn out. At my settings details, it shows that I use over 70% of my RAM. I can stop this by playing less games and keeping less tabs and apps open.
